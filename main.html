                            I can't forget everything 
                            I found him in mobile legend and I met him<bR>
                            This is what happens.<br>
                            I'm bored with my main acc <bR>
                            I created a Smurf account to beat up weak players<bR>
                            I used to play solo 10 games<bR>
                            It's fun because it's easy to win in a low-rank<bR>
                            After I reached 20 games I'm no longer happy because I'm bored<bR>
                            I was looking for my party mate back then in the world chat on ml<bR>
                            I started looking for maybe that afternoon<bR>
                            I've talked to a lot of girls before but I don't trip to chat with girls<bR>
                            11 pm i looked at the world chat on ml<bR>
                            I saw Daddy's Girl<bR>
                            I hurried to chat with him then and then I said "HI!" to him<bR>
                            I don't expect him to reply to me<bR>
                            And she follows my account and I follow back<br>
                            That's where our conversation started I made the topic <bR>
                            I asked her name age and what her name Daddy's Girl means <bR>
                            She told me because she said she was papas girls so daddy's girl<bR>
                            Maybe about 30mins we also talked that we were done about 12 <bR>
                            Because she was already asleep<bR>
                            After that the next day we didn't use to chat<bR>
                            I played with other girls

                            After a month of playing with girls <br>
                            I was surprised because Daddy's girl invited me to play duo<br>
                            I accepted and we played<br>
                            After 1 game of playing<br>
                            She said she was a hangover<br>
                            I know and I found out that she was drinking<br>
                            That's what I don't like most about women<br>
                            But I believed that someday she choose to change her personality for her love <br>
                            I hope she understands what I mean <bR>
                            She used to invite me all the time<br>
                            We were playing but no chat happened<br>
                            I was amazed because every time we would play<br>
                            She trash-talked the opponents<br>
                            I liked him there because of<br>
                            She's a bit rude to play<br>
                            For me, she was cool when I met him because she was a trashtalker<br>
                            Until we were always playing<br>
                            I'm not sure who was the first to chat with us then<br>
                            And that's when we chatted but at that time I didn't know his language<br>
                            So we used to talk Tagalog <br>
                            Until it was found out that she was from Cebu<br>
                            I told her if she knows how to speak Visayas cause I think she is Cebuana<br>
                            Then she replies "Ambot lang"<br>
                            Then I laugh because his type of woman wants me to like him<br>
                            And I also reply in the lobby chat "buang" cause she says "ambot lang"<br>
                            And she reply "Ikaw ra buang" and I started laughing again<br>
                            I'm glad because our language is the same<br>
                            I think it will be easier for us to talk if we use our real language  <br>  
                            We played again<br>  
                            in we always play and we are both trashtalker<br>  
                            The other random players we met had open mics<br>  
                            And we hear them talking<br>  
                            And they told us that we are jowa and we laugh on the chat box<br>  
                            Maybe they said that because of us playing so annoying<br>  
                            Just trash talk per game<br>  
                            Daddy's girl and I had the same vibes when we played

                            After a few days I found out that Daddy's girl <br>
                            Has a lot of boyfriends or maybe flirting with other guys<br>
                            Because I always see him play and I learn from him, she is not like that before<br>
                            Cause she always invited me to play when I'm online <br>
                            But that time she is so busy playing with other guys <br>
                            So I don't have the right to stop what she doing <br>
                            The cause was not in a relationship but maybe a duo only<br>
                            I started feeling doubt about her<br>
                            I check her history and I saw that she had another duo <br>
                            Then I feel jealous of that <br>
                            I'm restless I want to know who his dou<br>
                            I'd started searching for his duo to know what their relations <br>
                            And there's a guy that Daddy's girl is within the game <br>
                            Because he gave her a gift just buying diamonds<br>
                            We use the same language<br>
                            Daddy's girl invited me with her duo<br>
                            And then she spoke there in the chat box ingame<br>
                            And she said something that hurt me<br>
                            The word she say is "Pag storya mung duha kay inyu ko gaawayan or ilugan"<br>
                            It really means that she's not serious with me<br>
                            I realize that it's been a month since we played together<br>
                            I don't seem to take advantage of our constant togetherness<br>
                            The man she talked to me then was very rude<br>
                            She said what is the relationship with Daddy's girl<br>
                            I said we don't have a relationship, she's just my duo<br>
                            She said rude words that the woman didn't like<br>
                            She insulted Daddy's girl but I didn't say anything<br>
                            Until now I still keep it a secret<br>
                            So I wondered why Daddy's girl wanted<br>
                            Men love sex chats and say sexual words or bad words<br>
                            Because of what happened, I was hurt when I found out<br>
                            She even preferred to play and chat with that rude guy<br>
                            I was offline for 2 days, I had no plans to go back to ml<br>
                            But I accidentally click my ml app while cleaning my house<br>
                            And I read his chat<br>
                            And she said that she left the guy and that she would choose to be with me<br>

                            We are back to normal, we are playing again<br>
                            But she still has other male/boys playmates <br>
                            But I just ignore it<br>
                            Until we came together still in September <br>
                            Daddy's girl decides to make a smurf<br>
                            And she named it Erika?<br>
                            And I asked her if her real name was Erika <br>
                            And the answer is yes Erika is her real name<br>
                            I also made mine to accompany him to rank up<br>
                            We chat every day<br>
                            Always lsm (long sweet message)<br>
                            Even though I'm cleaning the house, my cellphone is turned on <br>
                            So I can replay him right away when she messages<br>
                            We always talk and we share what we did today like we update each other<br>
                            Erika doesn't tell the truth to herself<br>
                            That was the first thing I liked about him<br>
                            Because it's right she shouldn't trust me right away<br>
                            Because we don't know each other yet<br>
                            Erika never told me about her social media<br>
                            Like FB or Instagram but I also have no intention of asking him<br>
                            Because I don't want him to think I'm rushing him<br>
                            Maybe this is the time when I feel I'm so in love <br>
                            My heart is so heavy and complicated at that time<br>
                            This is the time I overthink him<br>
                            She never left my mind even though I took an online class <br>
                            That she distracted me from my mind<br>
                            When I wake up in the morning,<br>
                            I look for my phone to go online immediately <br>
                            And see if she messages me with "GOOD MORNING"<br>
                            When I saw if she texted me good morning<br>
                            I'm very happy because she was great to me in the morning<br>

                            The month of September is the one I will never forget<br>
                            Because this is "FIRST TIME I CRY"<br>
                            The reason is that Erika has been offline for 1 and a half days <br>
                            And I have no clue<br>
                            And I couldn't handle that, I was very depressed on September 29 to 30<br>
                            Because Erika is not online on that day<br>
                            I cried in my room<br>
                            I waited for 10 hours, I didn't turn off my cellphone<br>
                            My mom came into my room and saw me crying<br>
                            But not crying when she saw me, <br>
                            She saw my eyes red and there were tears in my eyes and she knows I'm crying that time<br>
                            But I didn't tell him the reason why I'm crying<br>
                            Because she hasn't seen me cry like that, especially when I'm older<br>
                            I'm waiting for Erika to go online <Br>
                            I always look at my friend list if his name is online <Br>
                            I cried a lot that night <BR>
                            I can't go out of my room even outside the house<bR>
                            And tomorrow September 30<bR>
                            I still waited like I did yesterday<bR>
                            And she finally went online at 4 pm <bR>
                            I cried a lot and I was very happy because she came back(tears of joy)<bR>
                            And this is what she told me after she returned<bR>
                            Huhuhu I'm really happy because she's online I can't stop I'm crying

                            Sometimes I tell him she won't drink anymore<br> 
                            Because I don't like women who drink<br> 
                            But she was so stubborn she would not listen<br> 
                            Sometimes I get disappointed <br> 
                            Sometimes I lose chances to be us in the future<br> 
                            I always tell her that the man she chooses <br> 
                            Is kind and will love you very much and the man has a good job<br> 
                            She can marry in the future<br> 
                            Maybe I thought of those things<br> 
                            Because I would like her life to be good in the future <br> 
                            Because I love this girl<br>
                            All the things we want are compatible<br>
                            Both in color and in food and music<br>
                            We both like it <br>
                            Until the month of November came the day of the dead (hallowen) <br> 
                            And we told wonderful stories about ghosts or something connected to Halloween story<br> 
                            We shared our stories and we rate the story how good the story was<br> 
                            For me, that memory is very fun<br> 
                            The first time I have hallowen story chat<br> 
                            Very fun that day as it takes me more to in love with him<br> 
                            Sometimes we planned to change our call sign<br>
                            Because I'm jealous of the number of men you chat with<br>
                            But you said don't because you love me <br>
                            so let's just call love so our call sign is still in the same <br>
                            Sometimes when I have a duo, she acts jealous<br>
                            But the truth is I don't know because his mind can't really be read<br>
                            Because Erika tends to play with people<br>
                            So you can't say what she said is true<br>
                            I always doubted him

                            Erika said that she is 17 and will have her birthday next year<br>
                            But she did not immediately say the date<br>
                            Maybe because she doesn't trust me<br>
                            Erika wants to admit something about me<br>
                            And she said she had a heart disease<br>
                            I didn't believe it at first<br>
                            I thought so much because of his illness<br>
                            He told me if I would still accept him even if she had a heart disease<br>
                            And I answered “YES” because your heart disease is not a barrier to our love<br>
                            I will accept you even if you are seriously ill<br>
                            I'm not the man who just because of heart disease, <br>
                            I don't like you anymore<br>
                            Maybe the other guys are like that <br>
                            But I'm different so I always tell you not to compare me to others<br>
                            Erika also told of her mother's death<br>
                            I can't go there because it's private<br>
                            Maybe because of what she said I was very happy<br>
                            For a long time, she trusted me and shared <br>
                            Her personal background information of her family and especially to herself

                            There was a storm in December near Christmas <br>
                            And lost signal and Visayas and Mindanao <br>
                            I watched the news on tv and I saw it in Cebu <br>
                            Massive damage was inflicted on Cebu they had the center of the typhoon<br>
                            I'm worried about what happened to Erika if she's okay<br>
                           3days after before the signals back, but it was still unstable<br>
                            But after 5 days he went online, she said she was using wifi with his friend<br>
                            And she just told the story of what happened in their place<br>
                            I'm happy because she's ok<br>
                            After that, we just enjoy happy CHRISTMAS and NEWYEAR<br>
                            But he said she had a heart attack on Dec 27. <br>
                            I'm not sure but what she said<br>
                            She didn't immediately tell me I was really worried about him<br>
                            I almost cried then but he said she was ok

                            It's the new year and it's almost January 6<br>
                            On January 4 they went Erika to the hotel<br>
                            Since his sister's birthday<br>
                            When my birthday is on January 6<br>
                            I regret<br>
                            Because I wasn't online for my birthday<br>
                            I didn't think of Erika because I was preparing for the day <br>
                            When my friends would come to my house that day<br>
                            She's mad at me because I'm not online<br>
                            Maybe she was worried about me<br>
                            And on his birthday on February 7<br>
                            She was online<br>
                            I thought she would enjoy himself with his fam and friends<br>
                            But she still chose to go online to ml and chat<br>
                            I didn't sleep on February 6, I looked forward to midnight/12pm on February 7 and<br>
                            I started great with happy birthday and messages on her birthday<br>
                            I gave him a great happy birthday and gave him nice messages<br>
                            I remember he album images in ml, then she took a screenshot of our chat<br>
                            And we had a dating chat on valentines<br>
                            Nag advance happy valentines nako 1am palang<br>
                            We're still fighting a bit now<br>

                            We always fight that month<br>
                            Because of jealousy or misunderstanding<br>
                            Or maybe I always doubt<br>
                            Cause she type a girl who always wants to chat with other men<br>
                            Until it got to the point where we no longer felt like chatting with each other<br>
                            The height of our pride<br>
                            There is no humility in us<br>
                            Maybe we haven't chatted for 5 days<br>
                            We were just playing with ourselves<br>
                            Then that night<br>
                            Chatted with me he said "HI"<br>
                            "Mingaw manko nimo oy kung wala ko mingaw di taka chatan ba"<br>
                            And then he seems weird to chat<br>
                            Felt as if he was drunk<br>
                            And she told me that he had been drunk for 5 days<br>
                            I didn't know why he always use to drunk<br>
                            Because he always says "Promise di nako mag inom, Stop nako ana"<br>
                            Came the point thought of whether to lower pride<br>
                            I'll just take care of him<br>
                            I always understood him in anything<br>
                            Then I was in school then<br>
                            I read his message that he hacked his acc<br>
                            At first, I didn't want to believe it because it was just my acc that he unfollowed<br>
                            Then I try to retrieve his acc<br>
                            But not really<br>
                            That's why I didn't force him<br>
                            He made a new acc then he named iring.!.<br>
                            I'm happy because he named the nickname I give him<br>
                            So think about how much I love you<br>
                            I accompany you in all things<br>
                            I want to give all my time to you

                            I always tease him that he won't leave me HAHAHA<br>
                            then after now, we are still talking happily<br>
                            I didn't expect that we would be in ml for one year<br>
                            I think that maybe we can talk only in ml<br>
                            I'm just really waiting for him to give his "you know" what I mean<br>
                            But I didn't think of that<br>
                            I told him how long I would have to wait<br>
                            It's ok with me even if it's a few years or it's took a long<br>
                            She said (2) I knew right away what 2 meant<br>
                            She also said that he was 16 and not 18<br>
                            I was surprised there<br>
                            Because we've been together for a year but I was fooled<br>
                            I believe that he has been 18 for 1 year<br>
                            So I will never really lose my doubts about him<br>
                            I always doubted because he didn't tell the truth<br>
                            As for me, I don't know him yet<br>
                            Even his face was not seen<br>
                            But I do not regret that I met him<br>
                            I am so happy because I met this woman that you are happy to talk to<br>
                            Just the same vibes and we understand each other in everything

                            In April, we were just fighting and teasing in the chat<br>  
                            I always tease him because he bends so fast<br>  
                            I know it's scary for him to be angry with me<br>  
                            but I noticed something about him<br>  
                            even though we were chatting, he suddenly played<br>  
                            I don't know who he is playing in ml<br>  
                            but I was surprised that he was not the same as before<br>  
                            she doesn't play when we chat<br>  
                            she might only play once<br>  
                            but this is strange<br>  
                            because he kept playing even though I was waiting for him to finish.<br>  
                            after he plays....Suddenly he started again without chatting with me<br>  
                            when I stalked him I couldn't see anything<br>  
                            because when I stalk her, there are always many boys stalking her and that's not new to me<br>  
                            I just let him go, maybe he just has a problem with me or I don't know the reason

                            the month of May, I don't know why but she always fights with me<br>  
                            his chats with me are not like before<br>  
                            she seems to have changed<br>  
                            she treats me like someone else who doesn't know me that well<br>  
                            I was really surprised because his attitude toward me was new<br>  
                            she doesn't chat with me anymore<br>  
                            It's like she's playing with something else<br>  
                            It's just like my brain is going to explode again because I'm always overthinking useless things<br>  
                            I know that she is playing with someone else besides me<br>  
                            but even so, he used to pay attention to me, but now he doesn't.<br>  
                            It's like he's pimping me out when I'm chatting and avoiding me when I'm online

                            I went online one day and chatted with him<br>  
                            if she replied to me then I thought what if I try to tease him <br>  if she gets angry and still does that means he has someone else<br>  
                            I made him angry<br>  
                            I pissed him flat<br>  
                            She unfollowed me<br>  
                              I thought it was normal to unfollow<br>  
                            It's been 2 or 3 days since they didn't follow back<br>  
                            I waited for maybe 2 weeks<br>  
                            seriously she never came back<br>  
                            I was sad about that<br>  
                            this woman always hurts me and doesn't even think about me<br>  
                            if she was going to leave, she should have said what was the reason for me to stop chasing him<br>  
                            I was overthinking if something wrong had been done to him because he didn't come back, I was very sad because of what he did<br>  
                            I have been online for a few weeks, maybe 2 weeks

                            6 months a lot happened in my life<br>  
                            many happy memories and memorable sorrows<br>  
                            I went online on ml in December, I think December 26, I'm not sure if it's the 23<br>  
                            then I was surprised because I immediately saw Erika on my friend list in ml<br>  
                            she didn't even follow me back!!!! she chatted with me and she asked me if I was mad at her<br>  
                            I said why I'm going to be angry<br>  
                            I'm not harboring anger toward him<br>  
                            I get angry sometimes because of his stupidity but it also disappears   suddenly<br>  
                            I told him what happened in my life when she wasn't there<br>  
                            Even so, I still love Erika even though she did something to me that I should have avoided<br>  
                            but I stalked him and saw something in his bio and his affinity<br>  
                            I know I was very sad at that time because of what happened to me and then<br>   I saw his affinity and bio<br>  
                            I cried for a while<br>  
                            I saw his bio says "I LOVE YOU EARL"<br>   I'm not sure about the boy's name<br>  
                            When I told him that he had a boyfriend, she said that he didn't love her and that he was just picking her up<br>  
                            IT'S LIKE I'M ALWAYS A CHILD FOOLING ERIKA EVEN IF I KNOW HER BEHAVIOR<br>  
                            I wondered why I love this person even though I hurt him several times and his love for me was never sincere.<br>  
                            maybe because I was always asking him to drive and hoping he would change for me

                            I don't want to call him love<br> 
                            Unexpectedly, we became comfortable with each other again and the spirit of our relations returned<br> 
                            and that's when he called her love and we were happy again
                            I hope we have more memories and conversations here in ml and endless love

                            Erika chatted with me that day but I don't remember what day it was<br>     
                            but he chatted with me that his grandmother was dead and I suddenly felt<br> sad and I told my fam because I shared it with them<br>
                            because Erika said that her grandmother was the only one who was on her side in their house<br>
                            I was sad for Erika but give me time for her to spend time with her grandmother<br>
                            after that, i thought Erika will be ok again and she will never be sad about losing her grandmother<br>
                            but it became worst because the people's in their house were always his enemies<br>
                            especially her aunt<br>
                            I want to help erika and give her advice at that time

                            The longer our relations here at ml went on<br>
                            I think Erika has become comfortable with me because she tells me what her problems are and she complains only to me.<br>
                            she said that he was very angry with his aunt that night<br> and I was very afraid of what he said that he was going to get his uncle's gun <br>and he was going to do something bad to that person and he didn't mention who it was but I knew if he was referring to it he<br>
                            I really want to help Erika so that she can feel better and stop thinking about bad things<br>
                            I tell him that we are only positive and that he is just entertaining himself by chatting with me<br>
                            she became sad again because he said his last name would be changed<br>
                            I told him that he can change that too when he grows up <br>with no one holding him back and do what he wants and change the things he should and want to change<br>
                            I'm here for you, I'll always be with you when you're sad and I'll sympathize with you in all your pains

                            that day, our conversation always got longer<br>
                            She told me that he was on a diet, i told him that she ate a lot of foods<br>to gain her weight. i told him jokingly<br>
                            and then i found out that she is not allowed to gain more weight<br>
                            becuase of his brain disease<br>
                            she didn't tell me that before<br>
                            I felt sad for Erika because she controlled eating always because of his illness<br>
                            I asked him if his disease can be cured or if she has to maintain his medicine for the rest of her life<br>
                            She said to me that she will maintain him for lifetime<br>
                            my tears drops on my eyes, because i read a lot about such disease <br>that i just don't want to say and different diseases in the brain but I dont know what kind of brain disease she has<br>
                            my tears suddenly flowed and my mind said that.....<br>
                            I just want to love this girl for life no matter what happens<br>
                            my heart relly only belongs to him<br>
                            I only have one request to god<br>
                            I hope we will be together in the end and we will make a memorable memories that we will not forget the tears and joy we feel<br>
                            and i hope the love we gave to each other will not be lacking<br>
                            and we will carry all our memories until death, I LOVE YOU ERIKA SO MUCH

                            I told him that I told my mom and sister about what happened in his life<br>
                            I apologized to him because I didn't tell him before I told my family<br>
                            but he said it's fine and he's just shy<br>
                            after that, for a few days, I talked to my sister that maybe he could chat with Erika<br>
                            he agreed with me and said that he would do it tonight<br>
                            and he chatted with Erika and asked if she was ok with what happened to her a few days ago<br>
                            and my brother wanted to know his age but Erika didn't tell me and I said <br>he's 17 now I'm not sure but that's what I remember<br>
                            then Erika told me not to do that next time because she might chat with bad words like she's a bigot o prevert hahaha<br>
                            and he said he was ashamed of my sister
